Here's my journey into Ketogenic dieting, for those that are unfamiliar with Keto , I go a little further into what it is all about, this is part 1 of 3 where I break down my daily routine and the foods I intake to help me stay strong on my Keto journey!

Keto Diet is a great way to drop weight quickly by having your body go through a process called ketosis. Ketosis is the process of burning stored fats in the body and it occurs by removing most carbs from your diet and instead eating things with high proteins and high fats. At first I was unaware of the vast array of great products that meet Keto requirements, but there are thousands! And the Keto diet has really worked miracles for me; in the past 30 days , I've been able to lose 12 lbs by following the Keto formula; for anyone new and starting off I would suggest this chart that I have in my home and use to help guide and plan my meals:

There are a lot of great products out there that helped me acclimate to this new change. My favorite morning starter is from a small company in the midwest  Nutpods Unsweetened Dairy-Free Creamers. They come in multiple flavors such as Hazelnut, French Vanilla, and Original. Honestly the flavor is better than my old creamer and the additional bonuses are out of this world! They're GMO free, dairy free, vegan certified, and even kosher; its a great alternative to dairy creamers or milk and it really helps me to stick to my Keto diet first thing in the morning. I personally enjoy the vanilla flavor one.

If you're an early bird gym-goer or rise before the sun for work like me, then a quick keto breakfast to whip up is Birch Benders Griddle Cakes Pancake and Waffle Mix. Anytime in the previous month that I had craved something sweet, particularly pancakes or waffles I just turned away or distracted myself so that I would not deter from my keto diet, then a few weeks back I found Birch Benders Griddle Cakes Pancake and Waffle Mix. They're a low carb way to fulfill my sweet tooth cravings without feeling guilty afterwards. While the package may say the carbs is 17 grams per 2 pancakes. Your body will actually only absorb 6 grams of carbs while also getting 9 grams of proteins! It has a some chocolate chips put into the mix which for me , add great taste and texture. I usually use a little less water than it says because I like my pancakes more on the thicker side.

If you feel like you need to add more flavor to your pancakes then I recommend Torani Chocolate Syrup. Is a sugar free syrup that can give your pancakes a great flavor without the sugar and carbs, plus it's gluten free!. You can also put it in coffees and other drinks to give it a chocolaty taste while not worrying about additional carbs and sugars.

If you don't feel like making coffee in the morning but still want something to energize yourself in the morning then you need to try Sunniva Super Coffee, I picked a 12 pack variety of this up on Amazon, and I use them for those days I need to run out the door. I was really surprised with the flavoring and equally surprised to find that this was a Keto approved, Lactose Free and Gluten free coffee. If you're going to get this, make sure you order the Sunniva variety pack your first time so you can try all their different flavors, they have Maple Hazelnut, Smooth Mocha, Vanilla Bean, and Creamy Black. Its less expensive than a coffee from most local coffee shops and it has more than twice as much caffeine as a traditional cup of coffee. Plus, to keep strong on the Keto path, their coffee's are packed with 10 grams of protein and have coconut oil in them to give you a fast-acting energy boost if you're making a quick run to the gym or need to wake up for a day of work. I personally like the Smooth Mocha flavor, it reminds me of the hot chocolate that I used to drink when I was a kid. They're made with organic Colombian coffee beans that are never treated with any pesticides or synthetic fertilizer because Super coffee starts with the best coffee.
