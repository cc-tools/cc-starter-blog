Growing up I dealt a lot with acne and in turn now deal with the scars that came from popping them. However, even with tremendous amount of scarring, I was able to go through my skin care routine to help even out damaged skin.  St Ives was my personal go to through my journey because the products work incredibly. My routine usually started with me just simply washing my face free of dirt and oils. I would use St. Ives Apricot Face Scrub with an exfoliating brush to move it over my face. St. Ives Apricot has a much coarser texture as opposed to other exfoliators but it works incredibly well and can get deep into uneven skin. I can feel the difference right after washing my face after a few minutes of using the exfoliator. It doesn't just look more even, you can even feel the difference of using it. I've used it religiously 2-3 times a week for the past few months and people tell me how great my skins been doing.  

After exfoliating, you need to moisturize to help give you a firmer look. It helps to use St. Ives Renewing Collagen and Elastin Face Moisturizer to give you those results. I've had other friends recommend me this exfoliator because the price is great and the results are even better. Most other moisturizers I've used feel like they just kinda sit on your face but this actually feels like incredible and you can see a younger looking skin after consistent use. People think its incredibly and tell me I look a lot younger than I really am.

If you're showering and want to use a soft body exfoliator than I recommend St. Ives Even & Bright Body Wash. Its a really gentle type of exfoliator that smells of Pink Lemonade and Mandarin Orange. Its also paraben-free and dermatologist tested so its safe for everyone to get that smooth polished and brighter skin
