Look at your body wash, now back at Old Spice, now back at your body wash. Sadly, your body wash isn't Old Spice but it could be if you made the switch. Don't know what kind of man you want to smell like? Want to smell like a island vacation with a pi√±a coloda in one hand and a coconut in the other while a cool fresh breeze brushes against your face? Then you might wanna try Old Spice Body Wash in Fresher Fiji Scent. 

More of an adventurous type? Like climbing snow covered mountains and going through a woodland adventure? Then you might like Old Spice Body Wash in Denali. Smells like you and the mountain are old college friends catching up over drinks. Like wearing suites and having a charming and confident smell to close deals? Then you might like Old Spice body wash Wolfthorn. Smell like suave CEO with a hint of mandarin orange for extra freshness. I personally like the body wash and deodorant in Swagger, the smell of a clean and confident man with a subtle smell of cologne. Do you want to keep that fresh man smell while doing sweaty work like fixing cars, saving children from a burning orphanage, or building houses for the needy? Then you can have all these amazing smells in a deodorant form. Look at your deodorant, back at old spice, back at your deodorant. You made the switch and now your deodorant is Old Spice. Be a mans man while knowing that you smell great and fresh all day.
